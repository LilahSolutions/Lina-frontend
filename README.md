Lina: Satellite-Driven Predictive Agriculture
Introduction
Lina is a platform designed to provide farmers with real-time insights and predictive analysis using satellite data and machine learning models. By centralizing diverse data sources from satellite systems and environmental databases, Lina offers farmers proactive recommendations, enabling them to better manage their crops, optimize resources, and mitigate risks due to climate variability.

Purpose of the Project
The primary goal of Lina is to empower farmers to make data-driven decisions to enhance productivity and sustainability. By leveraging satellite images, real-time weather data, and machine learning models, Lina helps anticipate weather events, predict risks such as droughts, and optimize water and crop management.

Main Features:
Field Profiling: Farmers can create a profile for their land, entering its location and area to geolocate it and receive environmental context.
Crop Monitoring: Users can input information about crops to receive tailored recommendations based on ideal growing conditions.
Predictive Analytics: The platform performs historical data comparisons to generate predictions for future events, allowing farmers to take preventive or corrective measures.
Environmental Alerts: Real-time alerts on potential risks such as droughts, floods, or pest outbreaks.
Problem Addressed
Global climate change poses increasing threats to agriculture, affecting crop productivity, water management, and planning. Farmers often lack access to advanced tools and predictive technologies, which increases their vulnerability. Lina addresses this issue by offering an accessible, data-driven tool for decision-making, helping farmers stay ahead of environmental challenges.

Solution Overview
Lina aggregates data from satellite systems, decentralized weather oracles, and historical data to provide farmers with actionable insights. The platform uses machine learning models to predict climatic conditions and crop performance, making it easier for farmers to adjust their strategies in real-time.

Project Structure
Frontend:
The platform's user interface allows farmers to interact with real-time data, create crop profiles, and receive customized alerts. A real-time chat interface has been integrated to interact with Lina, the AI assistant, where predefined scenarios have been hardcoded to demonstrate potential integrations.

Backend:
The backend connects to various APIs and datasets to provide real-time analysis and predictions. It integrates satellite data and machine learning models to forecast potential risks, such as droughts, and offers recommendations to optimize water and crop management. The current version of the backend is functional with hardcoded data, and further integration is planned.

How It Works
Data Input: Farmers input data about their fields and crops (location, crop type, area, etc.).
Data Processing: Lina gathers real-time satellite data and weather information, cross-referencing it with historical trends.
Machine Learning Analysis: The system runs models to predict future conditions and potential risks (e.g., droughts, floods, pests).
Recommendations: Based on the predictions, Lina offers personalized recommendations to the farmer, such as irrigation adjustments or crop management advice.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React, Next.js, HTML, CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express, Python for machine learning models
Data Sources: NASA Worldview, OpenWeatherMap, Chainlink Oracles, USGS, FAO Aquastat
Features to Be Added
API Integration: Full integration with live satellite and weather data.
Real-Time Chat with Lina: The chat system currently functions with hardcoded responses, but will be fully integrated with the backend in future iterations.
Machine Learning Enhancements: Refine ML models to provide more accurate predictions.
Global Scalability: Extend support for multiple regions and crop types.
Setup
To run the project locally:

Clone the repository.
Run npm install to install dependencies.
Start the frontend with npm run dev.
The backend can be started using npm start after setting up the environment variables for data source integration.
